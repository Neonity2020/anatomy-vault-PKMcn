**Gray matter** is one of the two types of tissue found in the central nervous system, the other being [white matter](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-anatomy/anatomical-structures/white-matter-1553796852#from=2). It contains a high concentration of neuronal cell bodies and their accompanying proximal axons and dendrites, all surrounded by neuroglia and blood vessels. The grey color comes from the cell bodies. There is no myelin here.

In the [brain](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-anatomy/anatomical-structures/brain-1553797804#from=2), **gray matter** forms the outer cortical layer of the cerebrum and cerebellum (i.e. the cerebral and cerebellar cortices). It is also present in the deeper parts of the cerebrum (such as the thalamus, basal nuclei, and other subcortical nuclei), cerebellum (deep cerebellar nuclei), and brainstem.

In the [spinal cord](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-anatomy/anatomical-structures/spinal-cord-1553805900#from=2), the **gray matter** extends downward from the brain. It has a butterfly shape with anterior and posterior horns. The anterior horns control motor movements, while the posterior horns receive sensory signals, allowing interaction between the environment and the body. In certain regions of the spinal cord (from T1 to L2 segments), there is an additional lateral gray horn that regulates the autonomic nervous system by activating the sympathetic nervous system.
